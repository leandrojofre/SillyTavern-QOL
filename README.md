# SillyTavern-QOL

Hi, I'm tired of setting up the releases workflow from a YAML file, so I'll do a quick overview here.
SillyTavern is an excellent application for running conversation chat AI models, whether for task or code assistants, roleplay, and a lot of other things; but we already know that. The idea of ​​this extension is to add small changes to facilitate the experience of using SillyTavern, either from quick access buttons in convenient areas, displaying useful information that is usually hidden; etc.

## Features

For now, the added features are the following:
- Add a quick access button to retry the last message, the same button that is usually accessed from the drop-down menu of the message input area. ![Captura de pantalla 2024-11-29 015518](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c71b42e1-cff7-491c-870e-c092d36015ac)
