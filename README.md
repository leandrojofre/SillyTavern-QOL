# SillyTavern-QOL

SillyTavern is an excellent application for running conversation chat AI models, whether for task or code assistants, roleplay, and a lot of other things; but we already know that. The idea of ​​this extension is to add small changes to facilitate the experience of using SillyTavern, either from quick access buttons in convenient areas, displaying useful information that is usually hidden/hard to access; etc.

## Features

For now, the added features are the following:
- A quick access button to retry the last message, the same button that is usually accessed from the drop-down menu of the message input area. ![Captura de pantalla 2024-11-29 015518](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c71b42e1-cff7-491c-870e-c092d36015ac)
- When generating a message returns an error, a sound will be played to inform you in case you have ST in the background.
- Allow the talking character's avatar to always have zoom applied, automatically changing the avatar when another character or the user speaks.
- Automatically cancel the generation of a message after a user input. For people, like me, who always edit or hit continue message to their own message and are tired of clicking cancel themselves.

#### Please, if you have any suggestions, do not hesitate to leave them. If you want to contribute, do not hesitate to fork the repository.
